    <h3>What is the jungle?</h3>
    <p>The jungle is the most unique role in the game, and is drastically more different than the other four that you can play. As said, instead of you being in a lane and facing down an opponent, junglers move through the jungle as quickly and efficiently as possible while killing jungle monsters for resources instead of lane minions. The way that junglers affect the game before mid-game, depends on which one can get more jungle objectives, and help their teammates kill their lane opponents more. So if you enjoyt running around the map, trying to affect your entire team as much as you can, you will love the jungle.</p>

    <h3>What are Jungle Objectives?</h3>
    <center><img src="./images/Baron_Nashor.jpg" height="500" width="750" alt="jng monster"></center>
    <p>In the jungle, there are four types of neutral objectives your team can get, and those are drakes, rift heralds, and baron nashor. Each of these objectives are difficult objectives that require atleast two people to claim them, however, the buffs you get from killing them are very worth it. Drakes give you permanent boosts to your stats depending on the element that is slain. Rift heralds allow you to summon the monster to deal heavy damage to turrets and if possible, the nexus. Finally, the baron nashor gives you a buff to your physical and magical damage, and greatly buffs you minions. As said above, each of these objectives grant the team an incredible advantage, so securing them are the junglers most important task.</p>

    <h3>An example of a jungler</h3>

    <p>While not the strongest, or the most popular champion, Amumu is one of the oldest and easiest champions to play in the jungle. Because of this, he is perfect for those who want to try out the jungle role, and don't want to play champions that are too difficult.</p>
