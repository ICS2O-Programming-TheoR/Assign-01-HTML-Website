    <h3>What is the Toplane</h3>
    <p>The toplane is usually a very secluded part of the map. This is because of the small amount of objectives in the top side of the map before the mid-game. Because of the toplane usually being left to a 1v1, the toplane is filled with self-sufficient champions who are strong on their own. The toplane is filled with bruisers, juggernauts, fighters, and few more. People who love to show off their skill whenever they can, love only having to deal with one opponent at a time, or just enjoy being in the middle of the fight will love this lane.</p>

    <h3>An example of a Toplaner</h3>
    <center><img src="./images/Renekton_0.jpg" height="500" width="750"></center>
    <p>Renekton is a very popular and strong champion for a number of reasons. First off, he is very strong in the beginning of the game, this is because of his high base damage, strong healing, good durability, and decent utility. Another reason that he is popular is that he is picked often in proplay due to the reasons above, which naturally attracts people to play him. Finally, he is a good counter to some of the most popular picked champions in the toplane, so sometimes you will have the edge when playing him.</p>
