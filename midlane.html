    <h3>What is the Midlane</h3>
    <p>The midlane is the lane that is directly in the middle of the map, and is home to a wide array of champions for you to choose. You can choose magic-powered mages who deal continuous damage with their abilities, or maybe a physical damage assassin who excels at defeating opponents faster than they can realise. The job of the midlaner is to not only beat your enemy, but to assist your jungler and the rest of your team whenever possible. If you enjoy helping your team while personally exceling, then you will love the midlane.</p>

    <h3>An example of a Midlaner</h3>
    <center><img src="./images/Sylas_0.jpg" height="500" width="750"></center>
    <p>Sylas is a strong and versatile champion who thrives in the midlane. Sylas is a popular champion due to his strong basic abilities, as well as having one of the strongest ultimate abilities in the game, which allows him to steal any of the enemies ultimate ability. He is also a good example of a flexible champion. This means that he has multiple ways of being played, he can be played as a strong battle mage who deals continuous damage throughout a fihgt, or he can go a burst mage build, and kill an enemy, in seconds. These are just two reasons why sylas is a popular champion, and a good example of what a champion can be.</p>
