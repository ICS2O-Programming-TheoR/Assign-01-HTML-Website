    <!-- Text for Introduction -->
    <br>
    <h3>What is the botlane</h3>
    <p>The botlane is the most unique lane compared to the mid, and toplanes. While the midlane and the toplane have one player from each team there, the botlane is unique due to the fact that two players from each team play there. The two roles that are found in the botlane are the AD Carry, and the Support, two very important roles.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>What are the roles</h3>
    <p>As said, the botlane is home to the AD Carry, and the support, two very important roles. The AD Carry is a champion that is very weak early game, and requires a lot of resources to become useful, but once they get enough items, they are the most dangerous player on the team. The support is the player chosen to help the AD Carry throughout the early game. So, those who enjoy being the strongest player in the match after the mid-game, will enjoy playing AD Cary, whereas those who enjoy helping the team instead leading them to victory will enjoy Support.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>An example of an AD Carry</h3>
    <center><img src="./images/Jhin_4.jpg" height="500" width="750"></center>
    <p>Jhin is the most unique AD Carry in the game, due to how fast he attacks. Every AD Carry is forced to build items that give them attack speed so that they can dish out their devastating damage as fast as possible, but instead of gaining attack speed, he gets bonus damage when he builds it. So, in the late game, intsead of being an AD Carry who kills his enemies with 10 attacks in 5 seconds, Jhin only needs to attack them once to kill them.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>An example of a Support</h3>
    <center><img src="./images/Thresh_0.jpg" height="500" width="750"></center>
    <p>The reason that thresh is a good example of what a support can be is because he can have many different types of playstyles. Some may play him as a strong and durable tank support, who takes as much damage for the AD Carrt as possible. Or maybe he will be played as a versatile engage support who gets his AD Carry as many resources as possible. No matter what though, Thresh is a great support for those who want to help their teams, while staying in fights for as long as possible.</p>
